# action-docker-ghpackages
Publish docker images to [Github Packages](https://ghcr.io) based on [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), with no configuration required.

1. Install this action
   - This as a dependancy [TBD](https://github.com/jtagcat/action-docker-ghpackages/issues/2). Copying the [workflow file](https://github.com/jtagcat/action-docker-ghpackages/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-ghcr.yml) to your repo works just fine.
1. Tag a commit with `v1.2.3`
